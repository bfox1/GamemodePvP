# GamemodePvP
------
A new way to play PvP Game.
--------------
This is a very expansive Plugin with such potential. 

This plugin will dive over every area of what you would expect to be in a GamemodePvP Server + the additional gameplay similarities
to Call of duty games, Halo, Battlefield. 

#Feature
------
Amazing, Easy to work with, Default and Custimizable Weapon Classes(Kits) for deciding what is right for you 
in the map you play on or the gamemode you are playing in. 

Kits will include
-Primary weapon(Like a sword or Bow)
-Secondary Weapon(I have no idea yet)
-Tactical Grenades(Blindness, slowness, etc)
-Grenade Type(Self Explainitory)
-Perks(In Match usuable Potion Effects to assist anytime during the match)
-Armor
-Killstreak Custimization(Things like UAV(If possible), Lightning Strikes, Bombardments)

Powerful and Custimizable Custom Player Handeling to provide a new way of communicating with other GamemodePVP Enabled Servers
(Will get into details about that later)

Ranking System similar to any other RPG game.
gain exp by killing oposite players, assists, calling in killstreaks, winning matches, etc.

With GamemodePVP Enabled Server active, Give ALL and ANY player the ability to leave one server, and join another with the
same rank and Weapons Classes from the previous one. This will become more clear in the future as to how this will be 
done.

Custom Regions, Void World Arena Maps, Arena Borders, Scalable map sizes, special Admin perms, and much much more!

#Contribution
---------
This plugin is under the GNU Public Lesser License and lets put license aside at this moment and all I ask is please respect The 
work our contributors do for those who are Forking our plugin and downloading it. I worked really hard to come up with
an amazing way to enjoy PVP to another level. 

Other then that, please, contribute what you like. Nothing is set and stoned, Im still removing Code and adding new stuff in. 
Ask me or any contributor that shows up if you have any questions on a part you wish to contribute to or need help figuring
out whats going on there. 

This is a Maven Project as you may know this project also requires ScalaLibrary/ScalaLoader, I will have a link to download soon. 
It is a special plugin put together by myself and it is the only way to make the plugin playable.
Plugin will also need a Add spigot.jar library for other things.
